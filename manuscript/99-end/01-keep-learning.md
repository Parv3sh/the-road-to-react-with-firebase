# Never stop Learning

The Learning Pyramid shows the relation between retention rates and mental activities, proving usable data for both teaching and learning. It is one of the most effective ways to measure lessons I have encountered since I started teaching programming. This is how typical mental activities break down according to retention rates:

* **5% Lecture**
* **10% Reading** - This book is a great start!
* **20% Audiovisual** - Screencasts are an excellent source of hands-on learning.
* **30% Demonstration** - Code was demonstrated throughout this book.
* **50% Discussion** (FYI: There is a [Slack Group](https://slack-the-road-to-learn-react.wieruch.com/) where you can participate)
* **75% Practice by Doing** - Use the practical chapters and purchase the source code to extend your understanding.
* **90% Teach Others** - Assist your peers in Slack communities, Open Source, or on platforms like Facebook Groups and Reddit.

At the start of this book I mentioned that very few people can master programming by reading a book, and throughout I have emphasized applying the lessons as the best way to retain them. As you can see, teaching others has the biggest return on investment. I had the same experience when I started blogging about web development, answered questions on Quora, Reddit, Stack Overflow, and wrote books. Teaching others forces you to dive deeper into topics, so you learn about the nuances of programming. Think of friends, coworkers, or online peers from Stack Overflow or Reddit who want to learn about using Firebase in modern applications with React. Both mentor and student can grow from the experience.
