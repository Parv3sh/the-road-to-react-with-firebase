## About the Author

I am a German software and web engineer dedicated to learning and teaching programming in JavaScript. After obtaining my Master's Degree in computer science, I continued learning on my own. I gained experience from the startup world, where I used JavaScript extensively during my professional life and spare time, which desire to teach others about these topics.

I worked closely with an exceptional team of engineers at a company called Small Improvements for a few years, where we developed large scale applications. The company offered a SaaS product that enabled thousands of customers to give feedback to businesses. It was developed using JavaScript on the frontend, and Java as its backend. The first iteration of Small Improvements' frontend was written in Java with the Wicket Framework and jQuery. When first-generation of SPAs became popular, the company migrated to Angular 1.x for its frontend. After using Angular for over two years, it became clear Angular wasn't the best solution to work with state intense applications, so they switched to React and Redux, which allowed the application to operate on a large scale. During my time there, I wrote many articles about web development for my personal website. The feedback I recieved from those who had learned from my articles helped improve my writing and teaching styles.

Currently, I am a self-employed software engineer and educator. I find it fulfilling to see students thrive by giving them clear objectives and short feedback loops. You can find more information about ways to support and work with me on my [website](https://www.robinwieruch.de/about).
