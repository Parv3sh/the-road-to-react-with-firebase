# Introduction

Modern web applications can turn out huge, bloated, and complex when implementing them as full-blown client-server architectures. Usually you not only have a fontend and a backend application with a database, but also an interface in between to let both entities communicate with each other. In my other books, I teach people about React.js for frontend applications, Node.js for backend applications with databases, and GraphQL or REST for the communication between both entities. Doing all of this by yourself can be a lengthy adventure. If you are looking for a solution in between, where you only serve your users a well-rounded client application experience, Firebase with all its features comes amazingly into play, because it offers you features such as a database and authentication out of the box.

The React with Firebase application we'll build in this book offered a solid foundation for my own business for a long time. It also taught me the fundamentals of databases, authentication, and authorization from a frontend developer's perspective. These are the main reasons I wanted to pass my understanding of React and Firebase along.

There are plenty of newcomers to React who are proeficient with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, who have learned React to build modern web applications, but haven't learned how to create backend applications for deeper business logic or how to connect React applications to databases. React can be overwhelming for new JavaScript developers, so I often recommend Firebase, since it is a good foundation before backend applications and databases. It takes you a step closer to building full-stack applications, allowing you to build sophisticated applications with a minimalistic tech stack.

There are also the more experienced crowd who want to bootstrap their ideas as businesses. However, using only React may not be sufficient for an application that needs a database, authentication, authorization, and hosting. Essentially, some have the right ideas but lack the tools to create a MVP (Minimal Viable Product). After I published my initial Firebase in React tutorial, I heard many success stories from those who built successful businesses, so I wanted to offer this foundation for profitable business applications with React.

All Firebase teachings in this book can be applied to other libraries like Vue, and frameworks like Angular. After it was purchaes by Google in 2014, Firebase became to a tool to replace backends using authentication, authorization, database management, and hosting. You'll learn how to create a well-rounded authentication flow with sign in (login), sign up (registration) and sign out (logout). We'll also cover features to improve the UX like resetting and changing the password of authenticated users and social logins with Google, Facebook and Twitter. To prevent just anyone from being able to access application, you will learn authorization rules that protect certain areas of your web applications from non-authenticated users. You'll interact with Firebase's database to manage users and other entities, such as messages for a chat application, and learn how to structure data in Firebase's database and interact with it. Finally, you will be able to implement full-fledged sophisticated web applications without worrying a backend application or database using only React with Firebase.

Firebase is an ideal fit for transitioning to full-stack business application development. It comes with features you would otherwise have to implement yourself, and lets you experience how a well-built interface (API) should perform before you use it for a RESTful or GraphQL server application. Firebase lets you focus on building React applications using their APIs, the way their developers intended. My hope is that this book illustrates the enthusiam I have for a minimalistic tech stack that lets you build large-scale applications.
