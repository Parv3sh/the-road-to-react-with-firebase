## FAQ

**Does the book use Firebase's Realtime Database or Firebase's Cloud Firestore?**

This book uses Firebase's Realtime Database that comes with a free tier for experimentation and provides a good overall learning experience. Many online tutorials and guides are targeted at Firebase Realtime Database developers, because the Cloud Firestore is the newest version, so few guides cover it. However, migrating from Firebase's Realtime Database to Cloud Firestore is a straightforward process, as shown in [this tutorial](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-firestore-tutorial). To use Cloud Firestore instead of Firebase's Realtime Database, consult the tutorial to find a migration path. After you have learned to migrate Realtime Database to Cloud Firestore, you can use what you've learned from older tutorials that use the Realtime Database for your Firestore application.

**How do I get updates?**

I have two channels where I share updates about my content. You can [subscribe to updates by email](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/rwieruch) or [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rwieruch). Regardless of the channel, my objective is to only share quality content. Once you receive a notification the book has changed, you can download a new version.

**How do I gain access to the source code projects?**

If you bought the complete course that grants access to the source code projects or any other add-on, you should find these on your [course dashboard](https://roadtoreact.com/my-courses). If you bought a course other than [the official Road to React](https://roadtoreact.com) course platform, you can create an account for that platform and find its Admin page to contact me with an email template. I can unlock the course after that. If you haven't bought the complete course, contact me any time to upgrade your content and access the other material.

**Can I get a copy of the book if I bought it on Amazon?**

If you bought a book on Amazon, you've likely noticed the book is also available on my website. Since I often use Amazon to monetize my free content, I thank you for your support, and invite you to sign up for [Road to React](https://roadtoreact.com). Send me an email (navigate to the */admin* URL) with an attached invoice and I can unlock the course package. You can also download the latest ebook version of the book on the platform.

**How can I get help while reading the book?**

The book has a [Slack Group](https://slack-the-road-to-learn-react.wieruch.com/) for people who want to follow along with fellow students and experienced readers. You can join the channel to get help or to help others. You might find that helping others learn programming helps you internalize your own lessons. If there are no other options, you can always reach out to me.

**Is there any troubleshoot area?**

If you run into problems, please join the Slack Group. Also, check the [open issues on GitHub](https://github.com/the-road-to-react-with-firebase/the-road-to-react-with-firebase/issues) or the GitHub repositories for the applications you build to see if any solutions are listed. If your problem wasn't mentioned, open a new issue where you can explain your problem, provide a screenshot, and offer more details (e.g. book page, node version).

**What if I cannot afford the complete course?**

If you cannot afford the complete course but want to learn about the topic, you can reach out to me. It could be that you are still a student, or that the complete course would be too expensive in your country. I want to support any cause to improve diversity in our culture of developers. If you belong to a minority, or are in an organization that supports diversity, please reach out to me.

**Can I help to improve the content?**

Yes, I would love to hear your feedback. You can open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/the-road-to-react-with-firebase/the-road-to-react-with-firebase) and express improvements to the technical aspects or the text content. You can also open pull requests on GitHub for documents or repositories.

**How do I support the project?**

If you find my lessons useful and would like to contribute, seek my website's [About Page](https://www.robinwieruch.de/about/) for information about how to offer support. It is also very helpful for my readers to spread the word about how my books helped them, so others might discover ways to improve their web development skills. Contributing through any of the provided channels gives me the freedom to create in-depth courses, and to continue offering free material.

**Is there a money back guarantee?**

Yes, there is 100% money back guarantee for two months if you don't think it's a good fit. Please contact me directly to seek a refund.

**What's the motivation behind your books?**

It can be a struggle to find up-to-date resources about modern technology online, and the available resources often cover only a portion of a topic, so I wanted to help remedy that by teaching about web development completely and consistently. I hope to support the less fortunate by giving content for free, or [giving back in other ways](https://www.robinwieruch.de/giving-back-by-learning-react/).
