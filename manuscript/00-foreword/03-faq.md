## FAQ

**Does the book use Firebase's Realtime Database or Firebase's Cloud Firestore?**

This book uses Firebase's Realtime Database that comes with a free tier for experimentation and provides a good overall learning experience. Many online tutorials and guides are targeted at Firebase Realtime Database developers, because the Cloud Firestore is the newest version, so few guides cover it. However, migrating from Firebase's Realtime Database to Cloud Firestore is a straightforward process, as shown in [this tutorial](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-firestore-tutorial), which will be referenced at the end of this book again. To use Cloud Firestore instead of Firebase's Realtime Database, consult the tutorial to find a migration path. After you have learned to migrate Realtime Database to Cloud Firestore, you can use what you've learned from older tutorials that use the Realtime Database for your Firestore application. You will get the best out of both worlds.

**How do I get updates?**

I have two channels where I share updates about my content. You can [subscribe to updates by email](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/rwieruch) or [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rwieruch) to get updates more frequently. Regardless of the channel, my objective is to only share quality content. Once you receive a notification the book has changed, you can download a new version from my [website](https://robinwieruch.de/).

**How do I gain access to additional material from the course?**

If you bought not only the book but a course that grants access to additional learning material, you should find it on your [course dashboard](https://www.robinwieruch.de/) where all your courses and course details are displayed. If you bought the course somewhere else and not on my course platform, you can create an account on my course platform and find its Account Page to contact me with an email template. I can unlock the course for you after that.

**Can I get a copy of the book if I bought it on Amazon?**

If you bought the book on Amazon, you've likely noticed the book is also available on my website. Since I often use Amazon to monetize my free content, I thank you for your support, and invite you to sign up for my [course platform](https://www.robinwieruch.de/). Afterward, send me an email with the attached invoice and I can unlock the course. Then you can also download the latest ebook version on the course platform in case a new version of the book got published.

**How can I get help while reading the book?**

The book has a [Slack Community](https://slack-the-road-to-learn-react.wieruch.com/) for people who want to follow along with fellow students and experienced readers. You can join the dedicated channel to get help or to help others. You might find that helping others to learn programming helps you internalize your own lessons. If there are no other options, you can always reach out to me.

**Is there any troubleshoot area?**

If you run into problems, please join the Slack Community. Also, check the [open issues on GitHub](https://github.com/the-road-to-react-with-firebase/the-road-to-react-with-firebase/issues) or the GitHub repositories for the applications you build to see if any problems/solutions are listed. If your problem wasn't mentioned, open a new issue where you explain your problem, maybe provide a screenshot, and offer more details such as book page, node version, operating system and the output of the stack trace for the bug.

**What if I cannot afford the course?**

If you cannot afford the complete course but want to learn about the topic, you can reach out to me. It could be that you are still a student, or that the course would be too expensive in your country. I want to support any cause to improve diversity in our culture of developers. If you belong to a minority, or are in an organization that supports diversity, please reach out to me.

**Can I help to improve the content?**

Yes, I would love to hear your feedback. You can open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/the-road-to-react-with-firebase/the-road-to-react-with-firebase) and express improvements to the technical aspects or the text content. You can also open pull requests on GitHub to improve documents or project repositories.

**How do I support the project?**

If you find my lessons useful and would like to contribute, seek my website's [About Page](https://www.robinwieruch.de/about/) for information about how to offer support. It is also very helpful for my readers to spread the word about how my books helped them, so others might discover ways to improve their web development skills. Contributing through any of the provided channels gives me the freedom to create in-depth courses, and to continue offering free material.

**Is there a money back guarantee?**

Yes, there is 100% money back guarantee for two months if you don't think it's a good fit. Please contact me directly to seek a refund.

**What's the motivation behind your books?**

It can be a struggle to find up-to-date resources about modern technology online, and the available resources often cover only a portion of a topic, so I wanted to help remedy that by teaching about web development completely and consistently. I hope to support the less fortunate by giving content for free, or [giving back in other ways](https://www.robinwieruch.de/giving-back-by-learning-react/).
