## Challenge

I write a lot about lessons I've learned, because learning and teaching has helped me a lot in my career.  Continuing the cycle of teaching and learning is how we call progress. My challenge is for you to teach others while you are learning. :

* Write a blog about a topic from this book. Try not to copy and paste, but teach your own way to gain the most from the passage of information. Find your own words to explain the concepts, solve problems, and dive into every detail of each topic. Teach not only fills your knowledge gaps, it can open doors for your long-term career plans.

* If you're active on social media, consider sharing tricks you've learned in this book with friends. You can twee tips about your latest interesting experiment, or show off your skills in web development Facebook groups or Reddit communities. Just be sure to take quality screenshots of your progress so viewers can follow along.

* Consider sharing videos through the book on Facebook Live, YouTube, or Twitch. Even if people don't follow they live sessions, you can always post the recording on YouTube afterward to maximize its exposure. Sharing videos is also an effective way to verbalize your problem-solving process. If parts between recordings are taking longer, cut the video or use timelapse to show the highlights. Also, consider keeping bugs and mishaps in the videos, as these can be valuable learning tools for viewers who run into the same issues. These are a few tips for a quality video:
  * Record the audio in your native language. English is preferable, since it will reach the largest audience.
  * Verbalize your thoughts, actions, and the problems you have to solve. The visual is only part of the challenge; the other part is narrating throughout the length of the video with relevant information.
  * Production values don't need to be perfect, just good enough that your message is clear and concise.
  * Check the audio before recording a long video to make sure it records clearly, and make sure the environmental acoustics won't hinder vocal clarity.
  * Increase the font size in your IDE or command line terminal so viewers can see any text you'd like to be featured.
  * Edit the video before you put it on YouTube. Keep things concise for your audience, leaving out reading passages while summarizing the steps in your own words.

You can reach out to me to promote anything you released. If your content turns out well, I may even include it with future versions of the book as official supplementary materials. I hope you accept these challenges to enhance your learning experience.
